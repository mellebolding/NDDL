# Loss function tweeking on [SNN energy model](journal.pcbi.1013112.pdf)
As part of the MSc course 'Neural Dynamics and Deep Learning' at UvA, I tweeked the loss function in a multicompartment SNN that showed predicitive-coding features by using an energy-optimising loss function. [Report](NDDL_lab_report.pdf) and [presentation](NDDL_Final_presentation.pdf).

In main.py the results and figures for the report are produced. In the Juypter notebook, there is a more interactive version of the SNN energy model.
